World has come to a standstill with travel restrictions in all countries, tens of thousands are infected everyday and thousands being deceased. Even after ten months start of this pandemic, the number of cases are still on rise. \n\nIn this project we will try to find the Covid cases in Ontario. Specifically, in this report we will review few of the **health center regions in Ontario province** that have huge number of cases and we use geocoding to view the **distributionof hopsitial** in this areas.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. And decide the possible location to estabilish  temporary medical centers to handle emergency medical crisis."
